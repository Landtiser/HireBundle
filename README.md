# HireBundle
An idea for the [10k apart](https://a-k-apart.com) challenge. Designed and built by [Chris Landtiser](https://landtiser.com/).

## Project Size
Combining Gzip and minified resources, the current initial page load is 5.4kb, including SVG icons.
The full package download option of PDF, Word Doc, Site HTML, Email HTML, Image Resources, and Instructions is ~1MB, when filled to the suggested text-limits on inputs.

## Progressive Enhancement
HireBundle is fully functional without CSS or JS. JS-reliant controls like the addition of optional input fields default to visible when Javascript isn't detected.

## Usability
Browser testing across desktop and mobile environments resulted in a fine-tuned user experience that relies on minimal complication to ensure reliable use. Processing is handled on the server, meaning the user's browser only needs to handle stylistic presentation.
